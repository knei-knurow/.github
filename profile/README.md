# Hi!

We are members of the Electronics and Computer Science Club in [Knur√≥w, Poland][knurow-wiki].

It has been created in 2015 and is led by mr. Donat Dubiel.

We have almost 100 members, who learn skills such as programming, electronics,
physics, web development, hacking, designing in CAD, and much more. We often put
these skills to use to build lots of [cool stuff][projects], together.

Feel free to explore our repos!
